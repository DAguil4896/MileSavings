# MileSavings
In this project, we query a NYC taxi trips database in SQL and created an algorithm that allows to maximize the number of miles saved using Python.

To run the project, be sure to download the Green and Yellow NYC Taxi data .CSV files (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) from January through June for the year 2015 and run the SQL queries individually. Next, run each of the cells in the python file individually as each cell will take a long to run.
